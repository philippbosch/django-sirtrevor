## Sir Trevor textareas now output html rather than markdown

When a block is saved SirTrevor will no longer save text as markdown, but will output valid html.

```
# Old

{
  "type": "text",
  "data": {
    "text": "One _two_ **three** [four](http://example.com)"
  }
}

# New

{
  "type": "text",
  "data": {
    "text": "One <i>two</i> <b>three</b> <a href='http://example.com'>four</a>",
    "format": "html"
  }
}
```

Sir Trevor will still load existing blocks formatted in Markdown, but will migrate the block data on save.

**You'll need to make sure your markdown parser accepts html or provide an alternative filter when the html format property is present.**

An example of how we deal with this in the sir-trevor-rails can be found here:

## Scribe is now used for text formatting

We now use Scribe to edit text rather than a mix of html/markdown. If you have built custom formatters for the existing codebase then these will need to be migrated accordingly.
